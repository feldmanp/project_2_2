# Robo advisor for trading equities

We are building a robo-advisor using LEX to provide assistance in trading equities on NASDAQ:
- The robo advisor will ask the user which stock they would like to buy and for how long are they planning to hold
- Based on the response, using Prophet the advisor will provide an estimate for the stock price in the given time period and will provide other stas like sharpe and sortino ratios
- Next the robo advisor will suggest to the user similar equities (i.e from the same sector) with better performance and/or better risk 

## If time allows 
We can add a prediction using different trading strategy for the stock (i.e bollinger bands, MA crossover etc.)
